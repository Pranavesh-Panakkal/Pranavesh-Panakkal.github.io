title = {Sensing Flooded Roads to Support Roadway Mobility during Flooding: A Web-Based Tool and Insights from Needs Assessment Interviews},
abstract = {Reliable sensing of roadway conditions during flooding is a long-standing, challenging problem with societal importance for roadway safety. Tools that provide real-time data on road conditions during floods can facilitate safer mobility, reduce vehicle-related drownings, enhance flood response efficiency, and support emergency response decision-making. Following the tenets of user-centered design, such tools ideally should address the needs of diverse stakeholders involved in flood response. Currently, the existing literature lacks a thorough understanding of stakeholder needs to guide situational awareness tool development in the area of roadway mobility during flood events. This paper addresses this gap by studying the needs of stakeholders responsible for managing flood response in Houston. Semi structured one-on-one interviews were conducted with stakeholders from different Houston-based organizations responsible for managing and responding to flood hazard events in the downtown metropolitan area. Interview responses were systematically analyzed to identify (1)\&nbsp;data needs for facilitating efficient and safe emergency response, (2)\&nbsp;the most and least valuable information available during flooding, (3)\&nbsp;communication and visualization strategies, (4)\&nbsp;factors influencing stakeholder trust, and (5)\&nbsp;factors influencing occupational stress during flood response. Finally, interview insights were used to develop a conceptual situational awareness framework and a prototype map-based tool that provides real-time road condition data during flood events. This study elucidates vital information for improving existing tools and providing preliminary guidance for future mobility-centric situational awareness tools that promote safer mobility and facilitate emergency response decision-making during flooding. Although the study focused on Houston, insights gained may be useful for comparable flood-prone regions. In developed countries, 40–60 percent of flood fatalities are attributed to vehicle-related incidents. Flooded roads and lack of real-time road condition data pose safety risks to first responders and reduce emergency response efficiency. Understanding stakeholder needs and developing tools that address them are essential for improving the safety and efficiency of emergency response, especially considering a potential increase in flood risk to urban mobility due to climate change and other factors. Following the tenets of the user-centered design process, this study identified stakeholder needs, conceptualized a framework for sensing road conditions, and developed an open-source prototype tool in the context of flood response in Houston. Insights gained in this study can improve the efficacy of existing mobility-centric situational awareness tools and provide preliminary guidance for quick prototyping of new situational awareness tools. Furthermore, organizations can use the insights presented here to help reduce work-related stress among emergency response personnel, thereby improving emergency response efficiency and organizational resilience.},

  author={Gori, Avantika and Gidaris, Ioannis and Elliott, James R and Padgett, Jamie and Loughran, Kevin and Bedient, Philip and Panakkal, Pranavesh and Juan, Andrew},
  abstract ={The record-breaking rainfall produced by Hurricane Harvey resulted in catastrophic and prolonged impacts on Houston’s transportation infrastructure, inundating entire neighborhoods and rendering them inaccessible to emergency response services. Harvey highlighted the vulnerability of the roadway network to severe inundation during extreme fluvial flood events and emphasized the need for a detailed roadway network accessibility characterization in order to determine which areas of the city are most vulnerable and sensitive to transportation disruption. This study poses an integrated framework to evaluate fluvial flood impacts on roadway accessibility to emergency services experienced by potentially socially vulnerable populations. This framework is applied to assess the time evolution of road network accessibility during Hurricane Harvey through coupling of observed road closures, flood modeling, and network analysis. Furthermore, by analyzing network disruptions at the census block group level, the correlation between impact severity and social demographics of the affected areas is investigated. This analysis is conducted for two highly populated watersheds within the city of Houston, which have contrasting flood management infrastructure and represent a broad range of demographic groups. This analysis advances understanding of the interactions between flood extent and duration, infrastructure impacts, and community vulnerability by (1) assessing the evolution of network accessibility between emergency service locations and flood-impacted areas, (2) estimating the flood-induced increase of the emergency response travel times of the aforementioned origin-destination pairs, and (3) highlighting potential correlations between physical and social vulnerability.},

  title={Towards enhanced response: Integration of a flood alert system with road infrastructure performance models},
  author={Panakkal, Pranavesh and Juan, Andrew and Garcia, Matthew and Padgett, Jamie E and Bedient, Philip},
  abstract={This paper presents a conceptual framework for improved situational awareness in severe rainfall events like hurricanes or tropical storms by coupling a flood alert system (FAS) with a model for transportation infrastructure performance assessment referred to as the access to critical facilities (ACF) model. The FAS is a flood modeling and alert system that leverages state of the art flood modeling and rainfall radar data in an efficient manner. The ACF model comprises of a road network of the study area, census data, locations of critical facilities like hospitals and fire stations, and a spatial and network analysis toolbox written in Python. The proposed framework can be used to evaluate, in near real-time, system level performance such as accessibility to critical locations and component level performance such as potential impacts on roadways. As a proof of concept, the coupled framework is applied to the White Oak Bayou watershed, Houston, Texas. First, the hydrologic and hydraulic characteristics of the watershed are captured through inundation maps forming a floodplain map library (FPML). Second, five accessibility measures quantifying mobility and accessibility are evaluated for each inundation map to develop the accessibility map library (AML). During a storm event, real-time radar rainfall data is used to identify the pertinent scenario from the FPML and AML. The selected maps are then communicated to stakeholders to support emergency response and situational awareness. Further, the results from the framework can also be used for disaster mitigation planning. Although demonstrated on a single watershed, the methodology developed in this study is transferrable to other regions to develop an integrated flood alert system in support of emergency response and longer-term resilience goals.},

  title={Infrastructure impacts and vulnerability to coastal flood events},
  author={Padgett, Jamie E. and Panakkal, Pranavesh and Gonz{\'a}lez-Due{\~n}as, Catalina},
  abstract={This chapter provides an overview of the impacts of coastal flood events, namely, tropical storms and hurricanes, on coastal infrastructure, leveraging examples from industrial and transportation infrastructure. We emphasize the multihazard nature of coastal storm events, producing wind, storm surge, waves, and rainfall, and their impacts on the built environment. Such multihazard events can impair the functionality of infrastructure in the short term due to inundation, as well as over longer periods due to damage requiring repair or replacement. Furthermore, these events can have cascading consequences, such as debris generation or spill of hazardous materials, which affect the health and safety of the public and environment. To illuminate these considerations, case study examples of infrastructure vulnerability and risk analyses are presented from Houston, Texas, United States as well as Rotterdam, the Netherlands. These examples highlight the flood risks to aboveground storage tanks common in port and industrial facilities as well as the risks to transportation infrastructure affecting mobility around the regions. Future opportunities for philosophical shifts in our approach to design and manage infrastructure in flood-prone regions are suggested, emphasizing possibilities for enabling “smart resilience” and for advancing performance-based coastal engineering in temporally evolving coastal settings.},
