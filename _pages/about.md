I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Rice University. My work with [Dr. Jamie Ellen Padgett](https://padgett.rice.edu) focuses on situational awareness and smart resilience. I'm primarily interested in predicting the performance of urban systems to stressors such as natural disasters and sensing the real-time performance of urban systems during events to inform emergency response and recovery. I'm especially interested in leveraging data, predictive algorithms, and tools to improve community resilience.
